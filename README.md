# [src-run] serferals


[Welcome](https://src.run/go/readme_welcome)!
The `src-run/serferals` package provides a CLI application for looking-up and
organizing media files, with support for movies and tv shows.

## JTT

This package represents a single project within a
[large collection](https://src.run/go/explore) of open-source code released
under the *SR* namespace, comprised of framework-agnostic libraries,
and a number of Symfony bundles. These projects are authored and maintained
by [Rob Frawley 2nd](https://src.run/rmf) and 
[collaborators](https://src.run/serferals/github_collaborators).


## Quick Start


### Basic Usage Video

### Installation

Before beginning, ensure you have created an account and requested a free API key 
from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) website. Once you have an API key,
take note of it and enter it when prompted by the `make` script.

> **Note**: For the installation to complete successfully, **PHAR archive writing 
> must not be disabled**. To find the location of your configuration file, run
> `php -i | grep "Loaded Configuration File"`. Edit your `php.ini` file, ensuring 
> the variable `phar.readonly` is uncommented and assigned the value `Off`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robfrawley/serferals.git && cd serferals
./make
```

If installation completes without error, the final line of output will be the 
version string of the serferals command.

```txt
src-run/serferals version 2.1.3 by Rob Frawley 2nd <rmf@src.run> (69975c3)
```

## Reference

My prefered CLI usage includes the `-vvv` and `-s` options, enabling verbose output 
and the "smart overwrite" feature.

```bash
serferals -vvv -s -o /output/path /input/path/foo [...] /input/path/bar
```

The only required option is the output path (`-o|--output-path`). At least one 
input path must be provided as an argument, though you can specify multiple input 
paths if required.

```bash
serferals --output-path=/output/path /input/path [...]
```
